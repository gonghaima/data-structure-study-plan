# Arrays Problems - Week 1

## üéØ First Week - Arrays Problems (Start Here!)

### Problem 1: Two Sum ‚≠ê (Easy - Perfect Starting Point)

**LeetCode #1**

- **Why start here:** Classic introduction to hash maps with arrays
- **Key concepts:** Array traversal, hash table usage, complement searching
- **Time to solve:** 20-30 minutes
- **Expected complexity:** O(n) time, O(n) space

### Problem 2: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock ‚≠ê (Easy)

**LeetCode #121**

- **Why next:** Introduces single-pass array scanning and tracking variables
- **Key concepts:** One-pass algorithm, tracking minimum and maximum profit
- **Time to solve:** 15-25 minutes
- **Expected complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) space

### Problem 3: Contains Duplicate ‚≠ê (Easy)

**LeetCode #217**

- **Why important:** Reinforces hash set usage and duplicate detection
- **Key concepts:** Set operations, early termination
- **Time to solve:** 10-15 minutes
- **Expected complexity:** O(n) time, O(n) space

### Problem 4: Maximum Subarray (Kadane's Algorithm) ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium)

**LeetCode #53**

- **Why crucial:** Fundamental dynamic programming concept with arrays
- **Key concepts:** Kadane's algorithm, local vs global maximum
- **Time to solve:** 30-45 minutes
- **Expected complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) space

## üìã Study Approach for Each Problem

### Step 1: Understand (5-10 minutes)

- Read the problem carefully
- Identify input/output format
- Think of 2-3 test cases (including edge cases)

### Step 2: Plan (10-15 minutes)

- Start with brute force approach
- Think of optimizations
- Consider time/space trade-offs

### Step 3: Code (15-20 minutes)

- Implement your solution
- Test with your examples
- Handle edge cases

### Step 4: Optimize & Review (10-15 minutes)

- Analyze time/space complexity
- Look for further optimizations
- Compare with optimal solutions

## üéØ This Week's Goal

Complete these 4 problems over 3-4 days, spending about 1 hour per problem including review time. This will give you a solid foundation in:

- Array manipulation
- Hash table usage
- Basic algorithmic thinking
- Complexity analysis

## üìù Next Steps After These 4

Once you're comfortable with these, move to:

- **Valid Anagram** (LeetCode #242)
- **Product of Array Except Self** (LeetCode #238)
- **Three Sum** (LeetCode #15)
