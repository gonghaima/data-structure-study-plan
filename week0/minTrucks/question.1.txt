Problem Statement
A logistics company is delivering a set of cargo loads. Each load has a specific weight (in tons). Each truck can carry either one or two loads at once, but the total load cannot exceed 10 tons.

In this task, you will need to identify the minimum number of trucks that are required to transport all the loads, by working out when to pair two loads onto a single truck, and when trucks can only carry a single load.

You will be given a list of load-weights, for example [1, 5, 5, 8, 9]. You need to calculate and return the minimum number of required trucks. In this question, the answer is 3 trucks, as you can load the trucks as follows:

Load the two 5-loads into the first truck
Load the 1-load and the 8-load into the second truck
Load the 9-load into a truck on its own
The array of load-weights will be provided to you in sorted order. No load will weigh more than 10 tons.

Function Signature
 
def min_trucks(weights: list[int]) -> int:
Input Format
weights: a sorted list of integers, each representing the weight (in tons) of a cargo load (1 ≤ weight ≤ 10).
Output Format
Return an integer: the minimum number of trucks required.
Constraints
1 ≤ number of loads ≤ 1000
1 ≤ weight ≤ 10
Example 1
Input
 
[4, 5, 5, 5]
Output
 
2
Calculation
Pair 5 and 5 → 10 tons (1 truck)
Pair 5 and 4 → 9 tons (1 truck)
Total = 2 trucks
Example 2
Input
 
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Output
 
3
Explanation 2
Pair 3 and 5 → 8 tons (1 truck)
Pair 4 and 6 → 10 tons (1 truck)
7 → its own truck
Total = 3 trucks
