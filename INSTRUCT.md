Follow /Users/stevengong/study/data-structure-study-plan/week1/ThreeSum/question.md, and /Users/stevengong/study/data-structure-study-plan/week1/SETUP_TEMPLATE.md,
Create test data, empty solution.js, and spec files in the folder /Users/stevengong/study/data-structure-study-plan/week3/ValidParentheses/question.md

give me a few common solutions, in solution.js, solution1.js, etc


create a complexity-analysis.md, refer to similar format /Users/stevengong/study/data-structure-study-plan/week1/Shortest_Palindrome/complexity-analysis.md



follow /Users/stevengong/study/data-structure-study-plan/week2/linked-lists-problems.md,
create one *.md file in week3 folder for the following, also include some related questions.



### Stacks and Queues
**Concepts to Master:**
- Implementation using arrays and linked lists
- Applications: parentheses matching, expression evaluation
- Monotonic stack/queue problems
- Deque (double-ended queue)

**Key Topics:**
- LIFO vs FIFO principles
- Stack overflow and underflow
- Queue implementation with two stacks
- Circular queue design

**Practice Goals:** 10-12 problems
**Recommended Problems:**
- Valid Parentheses
- Min Stack
- Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
- Sliding Window Maximum
- Daily Temperatures
