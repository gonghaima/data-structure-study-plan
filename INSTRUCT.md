Follow pattern /Users/stevengong/study/data-structure-study-plan/week3/ConstrainedSubsequenceSum, and /Users/stevengong/study/data-structure-study-plan/week1/SETUP_TEMPLATE.md,
Create test data, and spec files, also an empty solution.js in the folder /Users/stevengong/study/data-structure-study-plan/week4/GroupAnagrams/question.md

give me a few common solutions, in solution.js, solution1.js, etc


create a complexity-analysis.md, refer to similar format /Users/stevengong/study/data-structure-study-plan/week1/Shortest_Palindrome/complexity-analysis.md



follow /Users/stevengong/study/data-structure-study-plan/week2/linked-lists-problems.md,
create one *.md file in week3 folder for the following, also include some related questions.
